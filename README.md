Team Shift Happens is made up of six team members: Christener, Humairaa, Kit, Martyn, Rad, and Ziad. 
We developed an app called Intern - you might be wondering why. Simply because interns get all the grunt work and are paid the bare minimum similar to what our website does.

As a team, we designed a dashboard to keep track of boot campers on the School of Code Bootcamp. This was done by gathering data from Zoom APIs' and Webhooks. 

Key features:
- Authentication:
    This involves a user entering their credentials and signing up on the login page. We did this using Superbase.
- Track student attendance:
    This included the average percent of all students to date being displayed and updated hourly. It also included a download CSV button so the users could see         every boot campers attendance data.
- Zoom polls:
    This was designed to show the latest Zoom poll data. When a coach presses the thermometer button it sends out a poll. The poll is whether the boot campers feel 
    thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or thumbs-sideway based on the activity, demo, instructions, etc that they were given. Following this, they have 3 minutes to answer 
    and the dashboard will display a chart depicting the data, during the 3 minutes it is refreshed every 10 seconds after the click to send out the poll survey.
- Track student engagement:
    This involved whether or not they completed the Zoom polls, shared their screen, and . This has been mapped out and calculated. 
- Have a name picker:
    This is just a simple piece of functionality that allows the coaches to press pick, upon doing so the boot camper will be removed from the list. They can press 
    refresh if they want to get all boot camper names back. This lowers the possibility of the same person being picked more than other bootcampers.
- Alerts for when a boot camper is off for consecutive days:


// BELOW WILL BE JOURNEY
Team Shift Happens- Journey of 4 weeks.

Before the 4 week started:
Friday before the 27th of November we were introduced to our teams. Our first few steps were coming up with the team name and manifesto, everyone wrote down what was important to them for the manifesto and we grouped them based on similarity. We were told to come up with an idea that we would want to do. Through dot notation, we decided on a lonely adults app. We were then told that we could have the opportunity to work with a stakeholder. SoC gave us six repos to read through. We then had to say what our top three would be, again we did this through dot notation. 

Week one:
Monday the 27th arrives. We were told which project we could do, ours was one the School of Code had come up with which was delivering a Zoom dashboard to assist the School of Code in its business operations. Working with a stakeholder meant organizing weekly meetings to present our sprints, we came prepared having created slides documenting everything we had done, this was their opportunity to ask questions and ours too.  They wanted to be able to track the attendance of their boot campers as their current method is labor intensive.

Given this information, we created a FigJam board and started planning. To do this we took on an empathise approach. This meant understanding the problem by doing the five W's - Who, What, When, Where, and Why. We also needed to understand the possible users which might be the CEO of the company, the coaches, and the admin. Finally, we looked at how this problem is already being solved. With all this information we created three UX personas, refined the problem statement, and began the Disney ideation phase. Once we had completed this we moved on to the critic phase and began writing our MVPs' and MVEs'. We came up with three "Star", "Showman", and "Light". From this, we created User Stories for them all and wrote down what kind of features the different MVPs' would have. Then came low-fi, we created three low-fi dashboards to show our stakeholder. We then discussed the feasibility of each of the features and gave them T-shirt sizes. The two mandatory t-shirts were authentication and attendance tracking, they could then choose two medium and a small, or a medium, large, and small. 

Week two:
After all the planning was done in week one, we came onto building the front end with dummy data. This was following the advice of a partner from the School of Code. He also said that it would be a good idea if we deployed our website straight away, which we did. To make sure that we were organised at all times we started a Trello board and wrote down all the tickets that needed to be done. This was updated every day. Before we started coding our front end we did the final hi-fis with the features our stakeholder chose. We visited our FigJam board and did some top-level Epic planning before splitting into teams. One team worked on getting "Hello World" deployed and the others worked on setting up authentication using Superbase. Once this was complete we worked on completing the front-end component tree, and learning how to create graphs with data in JavaScript. Before commencing the actual build, we discussed what our tech stack would be: Next.JS, Tailwind, TypeScript, ELephant SQL, and Chart.js. Then began coding. We started with developing the skeleton of the dashboard. We then split into teams, this was always done via a random name picker online, or someone stating they wanted to do a specific ticket. In teams of three we
